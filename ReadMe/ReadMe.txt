This is a translator app that I found a tutorial for.  It took me approximately 2 hours to learn and code, with an additional hour in there to debug an issue involving modules that are not accepted by VS code when using a newer version of Python. 

To use: 

1) enter text into the top box
2) select languages
  2a) first language should be the language used in the first box
  2b) Second language is the language you would like it translated to
3) click translate

4) if you wish to reverse you can flip, clear and click also
