This is a translation app using python that I created after viewing a tutorial on youtube. I created this to help me better understand python as a coding language and to sharpen my object oriented programming skills. 

This code base has a second ReadMe that includes the start of the instruction manual, as well as my branches and comments on the process of my coding. 

This applications purpose is to take user input, have them select a language and then have this application translate that input to the selected language.
